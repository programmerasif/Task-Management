### Front-end Development(React.js)
During the initial phase of this project, I successfully completed several front-end objectives independently using React as the primary framework and TaskStackQuery for additional functionality. These objectives included designing and implementing the homepage, ensuring tasks are categorized into To Do, Doing, and Done sections for efficient task management, and creating visually appealing task cards to display task titles and descriptions. Additionally, I integrated a user-friendly form to allow users to create new tasks, with prompts for titles and descriptions. 
Furthermore, I implemented the edit task feature, allowing users to modify task titles and descriptions seamlessly. I also added a delete task functionality that allowed for permanent task removal, complete with confirmation prompts.

### Back-end Development (Express.js and MongoDB)

Regarding the back-end development, I successfully established a RESTful API using Express.js with endpoints that support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks. I implemented each endpoint with the appropriate HTTP methods to facilitate data manipulation. For data storage, I integrated MongoDB as the database system, creating collections to manage task data. The connection between the Express.js API and MongoDB was efficiently established to ensure seamless data retrieval and management.
